                        <p>QuintoAndar has grown its properties base exponentially in 2018. When I joined the company, my

                            to increase user engagement on the iOS native app. We decided to focus on the following

                            so we

                            rented a house without using QuintoAndar. We asked them to try to find their next home on
                            our iOS app that was available on App Store. Some questions that got asked:

                        <p>After prioritizing the usability problems we found on user research, we’ve run a competitive
                            analysis
                            with apps related to real estate, accommodation, and maps. We came out with some concepts to
                            give
                            more
                            information to the users while searching through properties on the map.</p>

                        <p>I've presented 3 different visual options alongside a Figma prototype to simulate the panning
                            on
                            the
                            map
                            during a design critique with 7 other design peers. After everyone exposed their
                            thoughts
                            about
                            the
                            visual alternatives, we've come up with a final concept to test:</p>

                        <h4>Defining a concept to test</h4>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pins on the map would display properties prices so people would save time exploring the
                                ones in their price range</li>
                            <li>When more than one property was on the building, we would display the number of units on
                                the pin, followed by a building icon.</li>

                            <li>As users scroll, the map would move to the property location, including other properties
                                nearby, so we would increase discoverability and the chance of the user finding the
                                perfect match for a house and book a visit.</li>
                            <li>Some users didn’t find out that there were more properties to scroll through the
                                carousel. That’s why we’ve Improved its affordance so people would guess there would be
                                more properties to scroll through</li>
                            <li>Because some people didn’t understand the numbers on the circles at first, we’ve added
                                the label properties to the clusters, people would immediately understand it means that
                                there are properties in the clusters.</li>

                            <li>We've added the name of close public stations nearby and a link to show the property on
                                a map, so users would better understand the surroundings of the properties.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>When users favorite a property, the pin on the map would display an icon</li>
                            <li>When users visit a property listing the pin would become faded</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Developers decided to code a quick prototype to simulate the interaction on the map as the
                            users would zoom in and navigate through the carousel. After that, we took the prototype to
                            a round of user usability tests.</p>

                        <h4>Usability Tests</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>We’ve recruited 5 more people who have previously rented a house to test our prototype. This
                            is what we've learned:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>People praised the price displayed directly on the map but complained about the time it
                                took
                                to
                                get
                                to the zoom level that would show the prices. Hence, we’ve decided to display price pins
                                for
                                some
                                properties when they were not close to others.</li>
                            <li>People couldn’t successfully understand the pins of building with more than one
                                property, so
                                we’ve
                                decided to use circles with numbers instead.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The map navigation tests also gave us good insights into how people use filters and their
                            expectations.
                            Thus, we’ve decided to work on the filters controls and improving the feedback about which
                            filters
                            were
                            applied for the next iteration of the design.</p>

                        <p>This is what we've learned on the usability tests and the action we've overtaken afterward:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A lot of users tried to use several filters at once and got no results. But there was
                                not
                                enough
                                feedback that the filters we're applied, so the users kept waiting for the properties to
                                load on
                                the
                                map. Hence, we've added a feedback message immediately after filters were applied to the
                                map,
                                including a modal saying no results were found and inviting the user to try other
                                parameters.
                            </li>

                            <li>Some users would go back to the map view and forget that filters were already applied,
                                so we
                                made
                                clear which filters were applied to the map view and make easy for the user to remove
                                any of
                                those

                        <h2> Third round: viewed history and favorites</h2>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description">
                        <p>With all of the previous improvements we've already reached a good number of visits booking,
                            but
                            we’ve
                            decided to stretch our goal. We concluded that if we focus on improving the Favorites and
                            the
                            Alerts
                            features we could boost visits bookings. Alerts is a feature where users subscribe to
                            regular
                            emails
                            that show them properties that they might like, according to their filters.</p>

                        <p>From analytics data and user interviews we've learned that even though more than half of the
                            users
                            used
                            those features, there was a good opportunity to increase their adoption.</p>

                        <p>So we’ve created some A/B tests to learn if some little tweaks would indeed increase visits.
                            We’ve
                            learned that:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>If we showed a suggestion to create an alert in the carrousel, we would increase visit
                                bookings.
                            </li>
                            <li>If we made the Favorite button clearer and more visible on the properties page, people
                                would
                                increase the
                                usage of the feature and consequently book more visits.</li>
                            <li>If we suggested users to create an alert right after they first apply a filter we would
                                increase
                                alerts
                                creation and consequently, visit bookings.</li>

                        <h3> Viewed properties</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description">



                        <p>Even though we've showed on the map which properties the users has already viewed, user tests
                            indicated
                            that people still missed a easier way to easily retrieve those properties. This, we built a
                            dedicated
                            list of viewed properties history. However, we were not sure where to place that feature for
                            customer to
                            adoption.</p>

                        <h4>Card sorting</h4>


                        <p>We've gathered some user's contacts and sent an email to them inviting for an interview in
                            person.
                            We've
                            recruited 6 people for a card sorting and usability test session in house, not only to find
                            out
                            where to
                            place this new feature but to grasp how users would organize other features on the app.
                            We've
                            learned
                            that:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>1. People tended to see this History feature more related to the Favorites section than
                                to
                                their
                                profile section</li>
                            <li>2. We needed to change the Favorite section label on the bottom bar to Viewed, otherwise
                                not
                                many
                                users engage with this new feature. The favorite section would be alongside it.</li>

                        <p>In 2019, QuintoAndar started an internal movement to make its apps more accessible. Event
                            tough
                            accessibility should be considered from the beginning, we've found out that our app was not
                            accessible for people blind using VoiceOver. We've run user tests with blind people and we
                            even
                            hired a blind QA tester to help us conform to accessibility guidelines. </p>
