                <h2>Behind the scenes</h2>

                <p>QuintoAndar has grown its properties base exponentially in 2018. When I joined the company, my
                    challenge
                    was
                    to **increase user engagement** on the iOS native app. We decided to focus on the following
                    challenge,
                    so we
                    could increase visit bookings and discoverability:</p>

                <p class="highlight">How might we help tenants save time while finding their dream home on the platform?
                </p>



                <h3>1. Exploratory User research</h3>

                <p>Because of the tight deadline for shipping the first version, we’ve started with a guerrilla test.
                    I’ve
                    invited one of the developers to help me interview 5 users that have previously rented a house
                    without
                    using
                    QuintoAndar. We asked them to try to find their next home on our iOS app. Some questions that got
                    asked:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Have you ever lived in a rented house? Tell me about the experience.</li>
                    <li>Have you heard about QuintoAndar before? If so, how would you describe it for a friend?</li>
                    <li>How would you choose a property to visit on the app?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We've tested this version of the app that was available on App Store by that time</p>

                > "What's this number? 2 places or is it on the 2nd floor?"

                <ul>
                    <li>Some users didn't understand the meaning of the numbers on the map
                </ul>

                > “How can I go back from here?”

                <ul>
                    <li>Some couldn’t find how to close the carrousel</li>
                    <li>Others took a great amount of time to realize there was a horizontal scroll on the carrousel
                    </li>
                </ul>

                > “Maybe I would give more information about ... any bus or underground lines around.”

                <li>Some wanted to see more information about public transport for each property</li>

                    > “Are there any history or something similar?”

                    <ul>
                        <li>They could not retrieve properties that they’ve seen before in the map, so they could
                            compare
                            them
                            with new ones</li>
                        <li>None of the users used or mentioned the favorites feature</li>
                        <li>People couldn’t easily find which filters were applied on the map</li>
                        <li>People didn't know if the filter was applied to the map</li>
                        <li>When people applied too many filters they wouldn't get a message saying there were no
                            results to
                            those filters</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. First round: map navigation</h2>

                    <p>After prioritizing the usability problems we found on user research, we’ve run a competitive
                        analysis
                        with apps related to real estate, accommodation, and maps. We came out with some concepts to
                        give
                        more
                        information to the users while searching through properties on the map.</p>

                    <h4>**Gathering feedback from around the company**</h4>

                    <p>I've presented 3 different visual options alongside a Figma prototype to simulate the panning on
                        the
                        map
                        during a **design critique** with 7 other design peers. After everyone exposed their thoughts
                        about
                        the
                        visual alternatives, we've come up with a final concept to test:</p>

                    <h4>Defining a concept to test</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Pins on the map would display properties prices so people would save time exploring the ones
                            in
                            their price range</li>
                        <li>When more than one property was on the building, we would display the number of units on the
                            pin,
                            followed by a building icon.</li>

                        <li>As users scroll, the map would move to the property location, including other properties
                            nearby,
                            so
                            we would increase discoverability and the chance of the user finding the perfect match for a
                            house
                            and book a visit.</li>
                        <li>Some users didn’t find out that there were more properties to scroll through the carousel.
                            That’s
                            why we’ve Improved its affordance so people would guess there would be more properties to
                            scroll
                            through</li>
                        <li>Because some people didn’t understand the numbers on the circles at first, we’ve added the
                            label
                            properties to the clusters, people would immediately understand it means that there are
                            properties
                            in the clusters.</li>

                        <li>We've added the name of close public stations nearby and a link to show the property on a
                            map,
                            so
                            users would better understand the surroundings of the properties.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <img
                        src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/158b3a22-751a-4b5a-b1db-47f14c1effa7/Tenants_iOS_-_After_-_Clusters_-_Edited_-_reduced.mp4](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/158b3a22-751a-4b5a-b1db-47f14c1effa7/Tenants_iOS_-_After_-_Clusters_-_Edited_-_reduced.mp4">

                    <ul>
                        <li>When users favorite a property, the pin on the map would display an icon</li>
                        <li>When users visit a property listing the pin would become faded</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Developers decided to code a quick prototype to simulate the interaction on the map as the users
                        would
                        zoom in and navigate through the carousel. After that, we took the prototype to a round of user
                        usability tests.</p>

                    <h4>**Usability Tests**</h4>

                    <p>We’ve recruited 5 more people who have previously rented a house to test our prototype. This is
                        what
                        we've learned:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>People praised the price displayed directly on the map but complained about the time it took
                            to
                            get
                            to the zoom level that would show the prices. Hence, we’ve decided to display price pins for
                            some
                            properties when they were not close to others.</li>
                        <li>People couldn’t successfully understand the pins of building with more than one property, so
                            we’ve
                            decided to use circles with numbers instead.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The map navigation tests also gave us good insights into how people use filters and their
                        expectations.
                        Thus, we’ve decided to work on the filters controls and improving the feedback about which
                        filters
                        were
                        applied for the next iteration of the design.</p>

                    <h2> Round two: **Filters**</h2>

                    <!-- Photo of filters page and filters on the map -->

                    <p>This is what we've learned on the usability tests and the action we've overtaken afterward:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A lot of users tried to use several filters at once and got no results. But there was not
                            enough
                            feedback that the filters we're applied, so the users kept waiting for the properties to
                            load on
                            the
                            map. Hence, we've added a feedback message immediately after filters were applied to the
                            map,
                            including a modal saying no results were found and inviting the user to try other
                            parameters.
                        </li>

                        <li>Some users would go back to the map view and forget that filters were already applied, so we
                            made
                            clear which filters were applied to the map view and make easy for the user to remove any of
                            those
                        </li>

                        <li>We've enhanced the distinction between rent prices and the full price and allow users to
                            type
                            the
                            price range (not only for accessibility matter but also because users struggled to correctly
                            set
                            the
                            price they wanted)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2> Third **round: viewed history and favorites**</h2>

                    <p>With all of the previous improvements we've already reached a good number of visits booking, but
                        we’ve
                        decided to stretch our goal. We concluded that if we focus on improving the Favorites and the
                        Alerts
                        features we could boost visits bookings. Alerts is a feature where users subscribe to regular
                        emails
                        that show them properties that they might like, according to their filters.</p>

                    <p>From analytics data and user interviews we've learned that even though more than half of the
                        users
                        used
                        those features, there was a good opportunity to increase their adoption.</p>

                    <p>So we’ve created some A/B tests to learn if some little tweaks would indeed increase visits.
                        We’ve
                        learned that:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If we showed a suggestion to create an alert in the carrousel, we would increase visit
                            bookings.
                        </li>
                        <li>If we made the Favorite button clearer and more visible on the properties page, people would
                            increase the
                            usage of the feature and consequently book more visits.</li>
                        <li>If we suggested users to create an alert right after they first apply a filter we would
                            increase
                            alerts
                            creation and consequently, visit bookings.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3> **Viewed properties**</h3>

                    <p>Even though we've showed on the map which properties the users has already viewed, user tests
                        indicated
                        that people still missed a easier way to easily retrieve those properties. This, we built a
                        dedicated
                        list of viewed properties history. However, we were not sure where to place that feature for
                        customer to
                        adoption.</p>

                    <h4>**Card sorting**</h4>

                    <p>We've gathered some user's contacts and sent an email to them inviting for an interview in
                        person.
                        We've
                        recruited 6 people for a card sorting and usability test session in house, not only to find out
                        where to
                        place this new feature but to grasp how users would organize other features on the app. We've
                        learned
                        that:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1. People tended to see this History feature more related to the Favorites section than to
                            their
                            profile section</li>
                        <li>2. We needed to change the Favorite section label on the bottom bar to Viewed, otherwise not
                            many
                            users engage with this new feature. The favorite section would be alongside it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2> Last round: making **the app accessible**</h2>

                    <p>In 2019, QuintoAndar started an internal movement to make its apps more accessible. Event tough
                        accessibility should be considered from the beginning, we've found out that our app was not
                        accessible for people blind using VoiceOver. We've run user tests with blind people and we even
                        hired a blind QA tester to help us conform to accessibility guidelines. </p>

                    <h4>**Key improvements**</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>We've added proper description to abbreviations, for example, FRI was now properly described
                            as
                            Friday on
                            VoiceOver.</li>
                        <li>We've described the Number of selectable elements in a row, for example, days of the week
                        </li>
                        <li>We've described if the day was available for booking visits</li>
                        <li>We've properly described buttons on the app</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2> Learnings</h2>

                    <p>The business outcomes we've achieved with those design improvements made me</p>

                    <p>I would have relied less on guerrilla tests and recruit better participants from the beginning.
                    </p>

                    <p>Increase in visits</p>

                    <p>People talking positively about QuintoAndar VoiceOver</p>

                    <p>What we’ve learned from it was that users couldn’t retrieve easily the houses they’ve seen
                        before.
                        And
                        that impacted the speed of comparison among houses.</p>
