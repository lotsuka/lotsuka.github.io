            <p>The sports and fitness gear market in Brazil grew by 22% in 2016. Centauro, a long-standing leader in the segment with hundreds of stores, faces competition with big online business with aggressive sales strategy. In 2017, it approached <a href="https://taqtile.com.br" aria-label="Taqtile company website">Taqtile</a> to understand its mobile site’s weaknesses and redesign it taking advantage of its multichannel brand strategy to increase online sales. We've decided to leverage the experience of transforming it into a PWA site (Progressive Web App). Together, we framed the goal:
            </p>

            <p class="challenge project3">
              How might we offer customers multichannel shopping experience to leverage online sales on the mobile site?

            <p>
              The research goal was to discover the main pain points along the customer journey while shopping online for fitness clothes, shoes and others. We wanted to understand what customers behave when shopping on mobile and if they understand the advantages of a multichannel brand.

            <p class="quote">Customers interviews and competitors usability test</p>
            <p>
              We showed customers the former Centauro’s mobile site alongside its competitors. While they were browsing and completing tasks, they gave us good insights on how Centauro is perceived compared to the competition and what their desires, feelings, and worries are while buying sports gear online.
            </p>

            <p class="quote">Stakeholders interview</p>
            <p>
              For understanding what feeling Centauro wanted the design to express, we've run a *Look & Feel Test* with stakeholders, showing them several benchmarks and inspirations. For each, they told us what they liked and disliked. After, we designed 3 different visual versions and got them voted by stakeholders. Then, we prototyped the winner and showed it to users.
            </p>

            <p class="quote">Usability tests</p>
            <p>
              We’ve shown customers the prototype with the key pages alongside the competitors’ mobile site. We gave them tasks to complete and got key insights that guided us throughout the project.

              <p>
                  Because we use a Design System, we optimized time by not designing every single page on Sketch. Instead, the developer and I worked closely together in Sprints mapping the screens and components that needed to be designed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typography and colors were chosen based on their brand book and then adapted to digital design, such as increased contrast for passing the WCAG test.
              </p>

              <p class="quote">Shipping Options</p>
              <p>The biggest challenge was to fit on the m-site all the shopping and pickup options that the desktop site featured. Because Centauro is also a marketplace, products from different sellers could have different shipping options.</p>

              <p class="quote">
                “Maybe I would give more information about ... any bus or
                underground lines around.”
              </p>

              <p>
                After designing several versions for the checkout flow, we've decided with the team and stakeholders what would be the best version. So we went to a busy shopping mall to interview 5 users. They've provided us key insights to proceed with the final design

            <p>
              Developers decided to code a quick prototype to simulate the
              interaction on the map as the users would zoom in and navigate
              through the carousel. After that, we took the prototype to a
              round of user usability tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve recruited 5 more people who have previously rented a house
              to test our prototype. This is what we've learned:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                People praised the price displayed directly on the map but complained about the time it took to get to the zoom level that would show the prices. Hence,  we’ve decided to display price pins for some properties when they were not close to others.
              </li>
              <li>
                People couldn’t successfully understand the pins of buildings with more than one property, so we’ve decided to use circles with numbers instead.

            <p>
              The map navigation tests also gave us good insights into how people use filters and their expectations.  Thus, we’ve decided to work on the filters controls and improving the feedback about which filters were applied for the next iteration of the design.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>People couldn’t easily find which filters were applied on the map</li>
              <li>People didn't know if the filter was applied to the map</li>
              <li>When people applied too many filters they wouldn't get a message saying there were no results to those filters</li>

            <img src="../../img/ios/filters_map_ios.png" alt="filters" />
            <p>People got no results when using several filters at once, but there wasn't enough feedback that the filters were applied so they kept waiting for the properties to load on the map. Thus, we've added a  message saying no results were found and inviting the user to try other filters</p>

          <div>
            <img src="../../img/ios/no_results_ios.png" alt="Image showing no results feedback" />
            <p>Some users would go back to the map view and forget what filters were already applied, so we made clear which filters paramenters were applied to the map view and made easy for the user to remove any of those</p>

            <p>
              With all of the previous improvements we've already reached a good number of visits booking, but we’ve decided to stretch our goal. We concluded that if we focus on improving the Favorites and the Alerts features we could boost visits bookings. Alerts is a feature where users subscribe to regular emails that show them properties that they might like, according to their filters.
            </p>

            <p>
              From analytics data and user interviews we've learned that even though more than half of the users used those features, there was a good opportunity to increase their adoption.
            </p>

            <p>
              So we’ve created some A/B tests to learn if some little tweaks
              would indeed increase visits. We’ve learned that:

            <p>
              In 2019, Centauro started an internal movement to make its apps
              more accessible. Event tough accessibility should be considered
              from the beginning, we've found out that our app was not
              accessible for people blind using VoiceOver. We've run user tests
              with blind people and we even hired a blind QA tester to help us
              conform to accessibility guidelines.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We've added proper description to abbreviations, for example,
                FRI was now properly described as Friday on VoiceOver.
              </li>
              <li>
                We've described the Number of selectable elements in a row, for
                example, days of the week
              </li>
              <li>
                We've described if the day was available for booking visits
              </li>
              <li>We've properly described buttons on the app</li>
