              rented a house without using QuintoAndar. We asked them to try to
              find their next home on our iOS app that was available on App
              Store. Some questions that got asked:

              real estate, accommodation, and maps. We came out with some

              find out where to place this new feature but to grasp how users
              would organize other features on the app. We've learned that:

                We needed to change the Favorite section label on the bottom bar

                <li>
                  As some people didn’t understand the numbers on the circles in the tests, we’ve added the word "properties" to the clusters, so they would immediately understand the number mean the number of properties in the area.

                <li>
                  Some users didn’t find out that there were more properties to scroll through the carousel in tests. That’s why we’ve improved its affordance so people know there are more properties to scroll through.

                <li>
                  As users scroll the carousel, the map moves to the next  property location, so we've increased discoverability and our chances of the users finding their perfect home

              through the carousel. After that, we took the prototype to a
              round of user usability tests.

              We’ve recruited 5 more people who have previously rented a house

            <ul>

                People praised the price displayed directly on the map but complained about the time it took to get to the zoom level that would show the prices. Hence,  we’ve decided to display price pins for some properties when they were not close to others.
              </li>
              <li>
                People couldn’t successfully understand the pins of buildings with more than one property, so we’ve decided to use circles with numbers instead.

              With all of the previous improvements we've already reached a good number of visits booking, but we’ve decided to stretch our goal. We concluded that if we focus on improving the Favorites and the Alerts features we could boost visits bookings. Alerts is a feature where users subscribe to regular emails that show them properties that they might like, according to their filters.
            </p>

            <p>
              From analytics data and user interviews we've learned that even though more than half of the users used those features, there was a good opportunity to increase their adoption.

            <p>
              So we’ve created some A/B tests to learn if some little tweaks

            <p>
              In 2019, QuintoAndar started an internal movement to make its apps
              more accessible. Event tough accessibility should be considered
              from the beginning, we've found out that our app was not
              accessible for people blind using VoiceOver. We've run user tests
              with blind people and we even hired a blind QA tester to help us
              conform to accessibility guidelines.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We've added proper description to abbreviations, for example,
                FRI was now properly described as Friday on VoiceOver.
              </li>
              <li>
                We've described the Number of selectable elements in a row, for
                example, days of the week
              </li>
              <li>
                We've described if the day was available for booking visits
              </li>
              <li>We've properly described buttons on the app</li>
            </ul>
